# Weekly Planner 📝

### Plan out your week and mark off the tasks you've completed through this simple and interactive planner app!

As I've dedicated myself to work on more weekly projects to strengthen my frontend development skills, I decided to create a simple task manager that I can use
throughout the week to check off personal tasks and chores throughout the day. The main languages of this project are plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This project was meant for me to better understand the uses of localStorages for updating and loading elements in their correct sections. 

Please give it a try and message me if you have any feedback!
